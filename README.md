The idea behind "PostWall" is to be able to support a 2010s style page serving "memes" where the user just needs a Email, username and password to share funny content.

ofcourse this project does not take in account many problems that could show if someone ever wanted to create and support such a website (Security, Legallity or content uploaded)

This small project showcases the use of asp.net APIs and Entity Framework Core as well as ASP.NET Identity to expose the APIs requiring a cookie to have access to resources like post creation or deletion
